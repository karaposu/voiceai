# Context Injection Feature for Voice AI System

## What We're Building

We're implementing a sophisticated context injection system that dynamically adds relevant information during voice conversations without disrupting the natural flow. The system consists of three main components:

1. **VoxEngine**: Core voice I/O engine handling audio streaming and OpenAI integration
2. **ContextWeaver**: Intelligent context injection engine with detectors and strategies
3. **Voxon**: High-level orchestration layer coordinating both engines

## Why This Matters

### Current Problem
In voice AI conversations, the AI often lacks contextual information that would make responses more relevant and helpful. Traditional approaches either:
- Front-load all context at the beginning (overwhelming and inefficient)
- Interrupt the conversation to add context (disrupts flow)
- Never add context during conversation (missed opportunities)

### Our Solution
Dynamic context injection that:
- Monitors conversation state in real-time
- Detects optimal moments for context injection (pauses, silence, topic changes)
- Injects relevant context without interrupting the user
- Adapts injection strategy based on conversation dynamics

### Key Advantages

1. **Natural Conversation Flow**
   - Context added during natural pauses
   - No jarring interruptions
   - Maintains conversational rhythm

2. **Intelligent Timing**
   - Multiple detectors identify injection opportunities
   - Strategies determine what and when to inject
   - Respects user speech patterns

3. **Adaptive Behavior**
   - Conservative strategy for formal conversations
   - Aggressive strategy for information-rich interactions
   - Adaptive strategy that learns from conversation patterns

4. **Seamless Integration**
   - Works with both client-side and server-side VAD
   - Compatible with OpenAI's response.create mechanism
   - Doesn't interfere with existing voice engine functionality

## Technical Architecture

```

### VAD and Response Control Integration

VoxEngine supports two VAD modes that affect context injection:

1. **Client-Side VAD**
   - Local voice detection
   - Manual response triggering via response.create
   - Full control over injection timing

2. **Server-Side VAD (OpenAI)**
   - Server detects speech end
   - Can auto-trigger responses (create_response: true)
   - Requires fast injection before auto-response

## What Needs to Change

### 1. Enhanced EngineCoordinator

**Current State**: Basic bridge between engines
**Required Changes**:
- Add VAD mode detection from VoxEngine config
- Implement response control coordination
- Add injection window management
- Handle both auto and manual response modes

```python
class EngineCoordinator:
    async def _monitor_injection(self):
        # Detect VAD mode and response settings
        vad_mode = self.voice_engine.config.vad_type
        auto_response = self.voice_engine.session_config.get('turn_detection', {}).get('create_response', True)
        
        # Adjust injection timing based on mode
        if vad_mode == "server" and auto_response:
            # Fast injection before auto-response
            injection_window = "immediate"
        else:
            # Flexible injection with manual control
            injection_window = "controlled"
```

### 2. Response Control Integration

**Current State**: No interaction with response.create
**Required Changes**:
- Monitor VoxEngine's response readiness
- Coordinate with FastLaneStrategy's response triggering
- Implement injection-before-response pattern

```python
async def inject_and_respond(self, context):
    # Inject context
    await self.inject_context(context)
    
    # For manual response mode, trigger after injection
    if not self.auto_response_enabled:
        await self.voice_engine.trigger_response()
```

### 3. Timing Synchronization

**Current State**: Independent timing in each engine
**Required Changes**:
- Shared timing state between engines
- Injection window calculations
- Response delay mechanisms

### 4. Detection Enhancement

**Current State**: Basic detectors without VAD awareness
**Required Changes**:
- VAD-aware silence detection
- Response timing prediction
- Injection urgency scoring

### 5. Strategy Adaptation

**Current State**: Fixed strategy behaviors
**Required Changes**:
- VAD mode awareness in strategies
- Dynamic threshold adjustment
- Response mode adaptation
