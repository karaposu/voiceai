# ContextWeaver Performance Analysis & Optimization

## Current Performance Metrics

From our comprehensive test suite:
- **Detection Speed**: 0.01ms average (excellent)
- **Injection Latency**: <0.001ms average (excellent)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Handles 1000+ ops/second
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal leak, good cleanup

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Detection Pipeline Optimization
```python
# Current: Sequential detection
for detector in self.detectors:
    result = await detector.detect(state)

# Optimized: Parallel detection
results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    detector.detect(state) for detector in self.detectors
])
```

### 2. Context Prioritization Cache
- Cache priority calculations for frequently accessed contexts
- Use LRU cache for get_relevant_contexts()
- Pre-sort contexts on insertion rather than on retrieval

### 3. State Object Optimization
- Use __slots__ for frequently created objects
- Implement object pooling for DetectionResult
- Reduce state copying with selective updates

### 4. Detector-Specific Optimizations

#### SilenceDetector
- Use rolling average for adaptive threshold
- Cache VAD state transitions
- Batch historical data updates

#### ResponseTimingDetector
- Pre-compute prediction windows
- Use numpy for statistical calculations
- Implement exponential decay for old data

#### ConversationFlowDetector
- Use trie structure for keyword matching
- Implement bloom filters for pattern detection
- Batch learning updates

### 5. Memory Optimization
- Implement circular buffers for history
- Use weak references for context metadata
- Automatic cleanup of expired contexts

### 6. I/O Optimization
- Batch context injections when possible
- Use async I/O for all external calls
- Implement write-through caching

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Impact, Low Effort**
   - Parallel detection execution
   - LRU cache for context prioritization
   - Circular buffers for history

2. **High Impact, Medium Effort**
   - State object optimization with __slots__
   - Pre-computation of timing windows
   - Batch learning updates

3. **Medium Impact, High Effort**
   - Trie/bloom filter implementations
   - Object pooling system
   - Comprehensive caching layer

## Benchmarking Plan

1. Create micro-benchmarks for each optimization
2. Test with realistic conversation loads
3. Monitor memory usage over extended periods
4. Profile CPU usage during peak operations
5. Measure latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)

## Success Criteria

- Maintain sub-millisecond detection latency
- Reduce memory footprint by 20%
- Handle 10,000+ contexts without degradation
- Support 100+ concurrent conversations
- Zero memory leaks over 24-hour operation
